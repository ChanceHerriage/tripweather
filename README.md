Trip Weather

TripWeather was created to remove the troubles of trying to take a nice Sunday drive and then it being ruined by a storm. What started as a simple solution has grown into quite a long list of things to be done. 

#### Planned Features:
* Update Notifications During Trip
* Saving Trip and Shared Trip Information
* Adding All Cars To The Trip

### How To Use:
Using TripWeather is really simple. All you have to do is enter your departure and arrival location. Everything else is optional. You can even save your trip for a later date so that you never have to worry about your drive being delayed because of something that you didn't know about.

Just enter and save the trip; TripWeather will keep you updated on everything important about your trip from then on. Really that simple, really that useful.
